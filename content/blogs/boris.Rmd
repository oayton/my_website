# IMDB ratings: Differences between directors

Using the IMDB ratings data set, we will now explore whether the mean IMDB rating for Steven Spielberg and Tim Burton are the same or not. First, we look at the confidence intervals for the mean ratings of these two directors. We see that these overlap. 


```{r directors, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "directors.png"), error = FALSE)
```

Now, we will run a hypothesis test for a null distribution, where we assume zero difference between the two. After that, we reproduce the graph above.

## Hypothesis testing 
Null: H0 = 0, H0 is defined as - "The delta between Steven Spielberg's and Tim Burton's average IMBD movie ratings **is statistically significant**."
  
Alternative hypothesis:  HA <> 0; HA is defined as - "The delta between Steven Spielberg's and Tim Burton's average IMBD movie ratings **is not statistically significant**."
  
Based on the T. tests conducted below (line 263-270), we note the following results:
  T Stat = 2.71
  T critical  =.16,1.13
  P = 0.01
  
  Since T Stat is out of T critical range, and the P value is less than alpha of 0.05, we reject the null. The difference in mean ratings is not statistically significant. 

You can load the data and examine its structure

```{r load-movies-data}
movies <- read_csv(here::here("data", "movies.csv"))

glimpse(movies)

```

```{r}

#Creating the data frame
Directors_chosen <- movies %>%  select(rating,director,title) %>% filter(director %in% c("Steven Spielberg", "Tim Burton")) 


#Creating the 95% CI around the mean data.
Director_selection <- Directors_chosen  %>% 
  group_by(director) %>%
  summarise(DF = (length(rating)-1), Mean_rating = mean(rating), SD = sd(rating), SE = sd(rating)/(sqrt(length(rating)))) %>%
  mutate(CI.lower = Mean_rating-qt(.975,DF)*SE, CI.upper = Mean_rating+qt(.975, DF)*SE)

#Plotting the data
Plot <- Director_selection %>% ggplot(aes(Mean_rating, director)) + 
  geom_errorbar(aes(x=Mean_rating, xmin = CI.lower, xmax = CI.upper, color = director), width = .1, size = 2) +
  geom_rect(xmin= 7.27, xmax=7.33, ymin = 0, ymax = 30, fill = "#696969", alpha = .2)+ 
  labs(y= "", x = "Mean IMBD rating") + 
  geom_point(aes(color = director), size = 3) +
  geom_text(aes(label = round(Mean_rating, 2), x = Mean_rating), size = 6) + 
  geom_text(aes(label = round(CI.lower, 2), x = CI.lower), size = 5) +
  geom_text(aes(label = round(CI.upper, 2), x = CI.upper), size = 5) +            
  ggtitle(label = "Do Spielberg and Burton have the same mean IMBD ratings?", subtitle = "95% confidence intervals overlap") +
  theme(title = element_text(size=8),
        #axis.text.y = element_blank(),
        axis.title = element_text(size=8),
        axis.text = element_text(size=8),
        axis.ticks = element_blank(),
        strip.text = element_text(size=8),
        panel.background  = element_rect(color="white", fill = NA),
        panel.border = element_rect(color = "black", fill = NA),
        #strip.background = element_rect(color="pink", fill="pink", size=.5),
        panel.grid = element_line(color = "#DCDCDC"),
        legend.position = "none")
Plot
```

Now, we conduct a t test using base R package and the Infer package.

```{r}
 
#Conducting the T.Test using a base R package
t.test(rating~director, data=Directors_chosen)
#Conducting the T.Test using the Infer package
T.TEST_inferpackage <- Directors_chosen %>%
  t_test(formula = rating ~ director, order = c("Steven Spielberg", "Tim Burton"), alternative = "two-sided")

```
